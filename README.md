# freddb
Learning the nuances of python as this is my first project.
My objectives were toL
- use an API /functionality to call data from the fred
- parse it, clean it
- then store it in a database.

Obviously easier said then done but I wanted to understand the nuances and play with pandas a bit. There wasn't too much to play around with to be honest since it was more cleaning, sorting, storing but it was as great introduction no less.

Learning how to play and utilize the python console in conjunction with the terminal was pivotal for this project. Avoiding compiliing all the time and running snippets of code and testing within the console was not only fun but easier for debugging segmentation.

Overall it was a simple project but a great one none the less.
