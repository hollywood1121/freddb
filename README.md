# freddb
Learning the nuances of python as this is my first project.
My objectives were toL
- use an API /functionality to call data from the fred
- parse it, clean it
- then store it in a database.

Obviously easier said then done but I wanted to understand the nuances and play with pandas a bit. There wasn't too much to play around with to be honest since it was more cleaning, sorting, storing but it was as great introduction no less.
